 THE  WORK  (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
 CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE").  THE  WORK
 IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF
 THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT
 LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY  EXERCISING  ANY  RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT
 AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT
 THIS  LICENSE  MAY  BE  CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR
 GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR AC‐
 CEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
    1.  "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the
 Work and other pre‐existing works, such as a translation, adapta‐
 tion,  derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations
 of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or  performance  and
 includes  cinematographic  adaptations or any other form in which
 the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in  any
 form  recognizably  derived from the original, except that a work
 that constitutes a Collection will not be considered  an  Adapta‐
 tion for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt,
 where the Work is a musical work, performance or  phonogram,  the
 synchronization of the Work in timed‐relation with a moving image
 ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose  of
 this License.
    2.  "Collection"  means  a  collection of literary or artistic
 works, such as encyclopedias and  anthologies,  or  performances,
 phonograms  or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other
 than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of  the
 selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellec‐
 tual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety  in
 unmodified  form along with one or more other contributions, each
 constituting separate and independent works in themselves,  which
 together  are assembled into a collective whole. A work that con‐
 stitutes a Collection will not be considered  an  Adaptation  (as
 defined below) for the purposes of this License.
    3.  "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that
 is listed at  http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses  that
 has been approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equiv‐
 alent to this License, including, at a minimum, because that  li‐
 cense: (i) contains terms that have the same purpose, meaning and
 effect as the License Elements of this License; and, (ii) explic‐
 itly  permits the relicensing of adaptations of works made avail‐
 able under that license under this License or a Creative  Commons
 jurisdiction  license  with the same License Elements as this Li‐
 cense.
    4. "Distribute" means to make  available  to  the  public  the
 original  and  copies  of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate,
 through sale or other transfer of ownership.
    5. "License Elements" means the following  high‐level  license
 attributes  as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of
 this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.
    6. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or en‐
 tities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
    7.  "Original  Author"  means,  in  the  case of a literary or
 artistic work, the individual, individuals,  entity  or  entities
 who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identi‐
 fied, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a perfor‐
 mance  the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons
 who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or  otherwise
 perform  literary  or  artistic works or expressions of folklore;
 (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person  or
 legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other
 sounds; and, (iii) in the case of  broadcasts,  the  organization
 that transmits the broadcast.
    8.  "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered un‐
 der the terms of this License including  without  limitation  any
 production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, what‐
 ever may be the mode or form of its expression including  digital
 form,  such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, ad‐
 dress, sermon or other work of the same  nature;  a  dramatic  or
 dramatico‐musical  work; a choreographic work or entertainment in
 dumb show; a musical composition with or without words;  a  cine‐
 matographic  work  to  which are assimilated works expressed by a
 process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting,
 architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic
 work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analo‐
 gous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map,
 plan, sketch or three‐dimensional work relative to geography, to‐
 pography,  architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a
 phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as
 a  copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus
 performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary
 or artistic work.
    9. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under
 this License who has not previously violated the  terms  of  this
 License  with  respect  to  the Work, or who has received express
 permission from the Licensor to exercise rights  under  this  Li‐
 cense despite a previous violation.
   10.  "Publicly  Perform" means to perform public recitations of
 the Work and to communicate to the public  those  public  recita‐
 tions,  by  any  means  or process, including by wire or wireless
 means or public digital performances; to make  available  to  the
 public  Works in such a way that members of the public may access
 these Works from a place and at a place  individually  chosen  by
 them;  to  perform the Work to the public by any means or process
 and the communication to the public of the  performances  of  the
 Work,  including  by public digital performance; to broadcast and
 rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or  im‐
 ages.
   11.  "Reproduce"  means to make copies of the Work by any means
 including without limitation by sound or  visual  recordings  and
 the  right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, in‐
 cluding storage of a protected performance or phonogram in  digi‐
 tal form or other electronic medium.
 .
 2.  Fair  Dealing  Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to
 reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights
 arising  from  limitations or exceptions that are provided for in
 connection with the copyright protection under copyright  law  or
 other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Li‐
 cense, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty‐free, non‐
 exclusive,  perpetual  (for  the duration of the applicable copy‐
 right) license to exercise the rights in the Work as  stated  be‐
 low:
 .
    1.  to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or
 more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work  as  incorporated  in
 the Collections;
    2.  to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
 Adaptation, including any translation in any medium,  takes  rea‐
 sonable  steps  to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
 that changes were made to  the  original  Work.  For  example,  a
 translation  could  be  marked  "The original work was translated
 from English to Spanish," or a modification could  indicate  "The
 original work has been modified.";
    3.  to  Distribute  and Publicly Perform the Work including as
 incorporated in Collections; and,
    4. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
    5.
 .
       For the avoidance of doubt:
          1. Non‐waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those ju‐
 risdictions  in  which the right to collect royalties through any
 statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot  be  waived,  the
 Licensor  reserves  the exclusive right to collect such royalties
 for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
          2. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those  juris‐
 dictions  in  which  the  right  to collect royalties through any
 statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived,  the  Li‐
 censor  waives  the exclusive right to collect such royalties for
 any exercise by You of the rights  granted  under  this  License;
 and,
          3.  Voluntary  License  Schemes. The Licensor waives the
 right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event
 that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that admin‐
 isters voluntary licensing schemes, via that  society,  from  any
 exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
 .
 The  above  rights  may  be  exercised  in  all media and formats
 whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights  include
 the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary
 to exercise the rights in other media  and  formats.  Subject  to
 Section  8(f),  all  rights not expressly granted by Licensor are
 hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3  above  is  ex‐
 pressly  made  subject  to  and limited by the following restric‐
 tions:
 .
    1. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only  under
 the  terms  of  this  License. You must include a copy of, or the
 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this  License  with  every
 copy  of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not
 offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms  of
 this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exer‐
 cise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of  the
 License.  You  may  not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact
 all notices that refer to this License and to the  disclaimer  of
 warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
 Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform  the  Work,  You
 may  not  impose any effective technological measures on the Work
 that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You  to
 exercise  the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
 the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporat‐
 ed  in  a  Collection,  but  this does not require the Collection
 apart from the Work itself to be made subject  to  the  terms  of
 this  License.  If  You create a Collection, upon notice from any
 Licensor You must, to the extent  practicable,  remove  from  the
 Collection  any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
 If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from  any  Licensor  You
 must,  to  the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any
 credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
    2. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an  Adaptation  only
 under  the  terms  of:  (i) this License; (ii) a later version of
 this License with the same  License  Elements  as  this  License;
 (iii)  a  Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a
 later license version) that contains the same License Elements as
 this  License (e.g., Attribution‐ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Cre‐
 ative Commons Compatible License. If you license  the  Adaptation
 under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with
 the terms of that license. If you license  the  Adaptation  under
 the  terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii)
 (the "Applicable License"), you must comply with the terms of the
 Applicable  License  generally  and the following provisions: (I)
 You must include a copy of, or the URI for,  the  Applicable  Li‐
 cense  with  every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Pub‐
 licly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on  the
 Adaptation  that  restrict the terms of the Applicable License or
 the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation  to  exercise  the
 rights  granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applica‐
 ble License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to
 the  Applicable  License and to the disclaimer of warranties with
 every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distrib‐
 ute  or  Publicly  Perform;  (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly
 Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective  techno‐
 logical measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a
 recipient of the Adaptation  from  You  to  exercise  the  rights
 granted  to  that recipient under the terms of the Applicable Li‐
 cense. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporat‐
 ed  in  a  Collection,  but  this does not require the Collection
 apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the  terms
 of the Applicable License.
    3.  If  You  Distribute,  or  Publicly Perform the Work or any
 Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request  has  been
 made  pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices
 for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or  means  You
 are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym,
 if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author  and/or
 Licensor  designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor in‐
 stitute, publishing entity, journal) for  attribution  ("Attribu‐
 tion  Parties")  in Licensor’s copyright notice, terms of service
 or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or  parties;
 (ii)  the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent rea‐
 sonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies  to
 be  associated  with  the Work, unless such URI does not refer to
 the copyright notice or licensing information for the  Work;  and
 (iv)  ,  consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adapta‐
 tion, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the  Adaptation
 (e.g.,  "French  translation  of the Work by Original Author," or
 "Screenplay based on original  Work  by  Original  Author").  The
 credit  required  by  this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any
 reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adap‐
 tation  or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a
 credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or  Collec‐
 tion  appears,  then  as part of these credits and in a manner at
 least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing  au‐
 thors.  For  the  avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit
 required by this Section for the purpose of  attribution  in  the
 manner  set  out  above and, by exercising Your rights under this
 License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
 connection  with,  sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Au‐
 thor, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You
 or  Your  use  of  the  Work, without the separate, express prior
 written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attri‐
 bution Parties.
    4. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as
 may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if  You  Reproduce,
 Distribute  or  Publicly  Perform the Work either by itself or as
 part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mu‐
 tilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the
 Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author’s honor or
 reputation.  Licensor  agrees  that  in those jurisdictions (e.g.
 Japan), in which any exercise of the  right  granted  in  Section
 3(b)  of  this  License  (the right to make Adaptations) would be
 deemed to be a  distortion,  mutilation,  modification  or  other
 derogatory  action prejudicial to the Original Author’s honor and
 reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,  as  appropri‐
 ate,  this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the appli‐
 cable national law, to enable You  to  reasonably  exercise  Your
 right  under  Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adapta‐
 tions) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE  PARTIES  IN  WRITING,
 LICENSOR  OFFERS  THE  WORK AS‐IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING  THE  WORK,  EXPRESS,  IMPLIED,
 STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES
 OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON‐
 INFRINGEMENT,  OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURA‐
 CY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT  DISCOV‐
 ERABLE.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY  AP‐
 PLICABLE  LAW,  IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
 LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
 OR  EXEMPLARY  DAMAGES  ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF
 THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
 SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
    1.  This  License and the rights granted hereunder will termi‐
 nate automatically upon any breach by You of the  terms  of  this
 License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or
 Collections from You under this License, however, will  not  have
 their  licenses  terminated provided such individuals or entities
 remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2,  5,
 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
    2.  Subject  to  the  above  terms and conditions, the license
 granted here is perpetual (for the  duration  of  the  applicable
 copyright  in  the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor re‐
 serves the right to release  the  Work  under  different  license
 terms  or  to  stop  distributing the Work at any time; provided,
 however that any such election will not serve  to  withdraw  this
 License  (or  any  other license that has been, or is required to
 be, granted under the terms of this License),  and  this  License
 will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stat‐
 ed above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
    1. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or  a
 Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
 Work on the same terms and conditions as the license  granted  to
 You under this License.
    2. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
 Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the  original  Work
 on  the  same  terms and conditions as the license granted to You
 under this License.
    3. If any provision of this License is invalid  or  unenforce‐
 able  under  applicable  law, it shall not affect the validity or
 enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
 without  further  action  by  the parties to this agreement, such
 provision shall be reformed to the minimum  extent  necessary  to
 make such provision valid and enforceable.
    4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived
 and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be
 in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver
 or consent.
    5. This License constitutes the entire agreement  between  the
 parties  with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no un‐
 derstandings, agreements or representations with respect  to  the
 Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any addi‐
 tional provisions that may appear in any communication from  You.
 This  License  may  not  be  modified  without the mutual written
 agreement of the Licensor and You.
    6. The rights granted under, and  the  subject  matter  refer‐
 enced,  in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of
 the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and  Artistic
 Works  (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of
 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996,  the  WIPO  Performances
 and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Conven‐
 tion (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject mat‐
 ter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License
 terms are sought to be enforced according  to  the  corresponding
 provisions  of  the  implementation of those treaty provisions in
 the applicable national law. If  the  standard  suite  of  rights
 granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights
 not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed
 to  be  included  in the License; this License is not intended to
 restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.
